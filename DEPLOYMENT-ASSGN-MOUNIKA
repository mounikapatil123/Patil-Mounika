DEPLOYMENT:




Q)Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime?

Answer:-

approach to update a containerâ€™s image in a deployment with zero downtime:

Scale Up the Deployment:
First, increase the number of replicas to ensure there is more than one instance running. This helps maintain availability during the update.

->kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=2

Update the Deployment Image:

Update the deployment to use the new container image.

->kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment my-container=my-new-image:latest

Monitor the Update:

Check the status of the deployment to ensure the update is progressing smoothly.

->kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment

Scale Down the Deployment:

Once the update is complete and the new pods are running successfully, scale the deployment back to the original number of replicas.

->kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=1

By scaling up the deployment before updating the image,  ensure that there is always at least one pod running the application, thus achieving zero downtime.
